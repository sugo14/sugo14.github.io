# sugo14's Portfolio

My unique personal portfolio site designed so that it could theoretically be exactly reproduced in a standard terminal emulator. This meant I had to do a bunch of cool stuff to get different "regular" elements working, so please check it out!

Visit it at [sugo14.github.io](https://sugo14.github.io).

Current state: first draft finished!
